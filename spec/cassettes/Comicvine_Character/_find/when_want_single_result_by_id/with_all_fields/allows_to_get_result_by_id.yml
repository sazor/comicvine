        born on <a href=\"..\/..\/naltor\/34-54952\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Naltor<\/a>
        in the thirtieth century. Naltor''s native denizens are genetically inclined
        to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age,
        Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more
        able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future
        while awake, than any other. Nura''s exceptional beauty often hid the fact
        that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she
        had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy''s
        intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions
        in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"\/legion-of-super-heroes\/4060-19241\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\">Legion of Super-Heroes<\/a> on a mission in space.
        Determined to prevent their deaths, she introduced herself to the Legion using
        the code name of Dream Girl.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p style=\"\">Dream Girl
        was created in 1964 by writer <a href=\"\/edmond-hamilton\/4040-42401\/\"

        data-ref-id=\"4050-3105\">Adventure Comics<\/a> #310. She became the sixth
        female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall.
        As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous
        member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"..\/..\/marilyn-monroe\/29-16582\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe<\/a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde
        hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on
        her right cheek. Despite her looks, Dream Girl was also conceived to be one
        of the Legion''s most intelligent and capable members.<\/p><p style=\"\">

        from her vision that several of the Legionnaires would face death in an explosion
        in space if they remained members of the team. At one of the Legion''s open
        try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of
        the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire
        fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"\/starman\/4005-1260\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\">Star
        Boy<\/a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream
        Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed
        Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"\/lightning-lass\/4005-30997\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Lightning Lass<\/a>, who had her electrical powers
        seemingly removed by Nura''s Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned
        out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies
        that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning
        Lass'' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of
        gravity.<\/p><p style=\"\">Once the truth of Dream Girl''s scheme came out,
        the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their
        best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead
        to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"\/legion-of-substitute-heroes\/4060-47111\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4060-47111\">Legion of Substitute Heroes<\/a> so she would have
        time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level
        powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance.
        Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"\/supergirl\/4005-2351\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl<\/a>
        and <a href=\"\/superman\/4005-1807\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy<\/a>
        were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined
        the team.<\/p><p style=\"\">With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure,
        a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion''s
        sexy-costume era of the 70''s), and boldly confident personality, the male
        Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team,
        and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to
        back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her
        female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her
        natural charm and charisma.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247<\/h3><figure

        name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it,
        \"It just says I''m from Naltor y''know.\" She also claimed to have been the
        first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that
        was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour<\/i> Legion stories. For
        most of this continuity''s duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although
        she was still Star Boy''s girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy,
        falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister
        of <a href=\"\/black-witch\/4005-30998\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30998\">Mysa<\/a>,
        who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained
        Legion membership under the codename Dreamer. Unlike other continuities her
        Legion costume featured a cape, as well as a diamond-shaped \"cleavage window\"
        in the front.<\/p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime<\/h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1534216\"

        disconnected and \"spaced out\" personality in this continuity, since her
        precognition often interfered with her perception of current reality and she
        had trouble differentiating between the two. She wore a midriff-baring costume
        with a silver top and black leggings. In her first action as a Legionnaire
        she stopped an assassination attempt on the United Planets delegates by a

        like they were beaten, until Karate Kid woke Dream Girl from a daydream and
        she took down the assassin down with ease, saying that she thought they had
        already defeated him. Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl''s
        precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to
        it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking
        about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later,
        Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"..\/..\/shadow-lass\/29-1261\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow

        Dream Girl and the Legion returned to being very much like the original team
        prior to the Five Year Gap, with a few differences. At the beginning of the
        story arc several members of the Legion (including the original Dream Girl
        in her classic silver costume) mysteriously appeared in the 21st century.
        Other Legionnaires were scattered and trapped in different places throughout
        the universe. Dream Girl was captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain
        <a href=\"..\/..\/doctor-destiny\/29-10453\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny<\/a>
        in <a href=\"..\/..\/arkham-asylum\/34-31682\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum<\/a>,
        where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions.
        She was rescued by the <a href=\"..\/..\/justice-society-of-america\/65-27589\/\"

        longtime love Thom Kallor (formerly Star Boy), who had been flung back in
        time to become the new <a href=\"..\/..\/starman\/29-7646\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman<\/a>.
        In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic,
        since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time
        unprepared. She felt terribly for him and believed that the 21st-century methods
        of treating his mental illness were barbaric. Dream Girl has since established
        a connection to the realm of ''<a href=\"\/the-dreaming\/4020-55857\/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55857\">The

        to save their lives. During this time she joined the <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-of-substitute-heroes\/65-47111\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes<\/a> until she reunited with
        Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for accidentally
        killing Nura''s former lover, a Naltorian named Kenz Nahor, in self-defense
        after Nahor attempted to kill Star Boy out of jealousy.<\/p><p style=\"\">
        <\/p><h4>Leader of the Legion<\/h4><p style=\"\">Dream Girl soon rejoined
        the Legion and continued serving as a highly valued member. After <a href=\"..\/..\/lightning-lad\/29-1253\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad<\/a>''s term as Legion leader went horribly
        awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced
        that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially
        scoffed at the idea of the Legion''s glamor girl winning the job, until they
        realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had
        she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected
        leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a
        href=\"..\/..\/saturn-girl\/29-1273\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl<\/a>).<\/p><p
        style=\"\">Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with
        one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"..\/..\/great-darkness-saga\/39-40773\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga<\/a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"..\/..\/darkseid\/29-2349\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid<\/a> attempted to conquer the whole of the United
        Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl''s able
        leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle.
        During this time Nura''s sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her
        mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling
        herself the <a href=\"..\/..\/white-witch\/29-30998\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White
        Witch<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\">Though Dream Girl again ran for leader the following
        term, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction
        about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship had suffered.
        After Star Boy left the team to become planetary champion of his home planet,

        style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>The Universo Project<\/h4><p style=\"\">Dream Girl became
        one of the first Legion members to demonstrate sufficient willpower to utilize
        her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving
        her the ability of telekinesis. She later was one of four Legionnaires singled
        out by <a href=\"\/universo\/4005-22717\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22717\">Universo<\/a>
        as the most dangerous obstacles in his attempt to take over the Earth (along
        with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four were captured and
        held prisoner with their memories suppressed. Saturn Girl eventually regained
        her memory and helped her teammates engineer an escape, after which they turned
        the tables on Universo. It was assumed that they were isolated as the most
        dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have
        been that those four had the most resistance to Universo''s mind control --
        even more than the Legion''s (then current) telepath, <a href=\"\/tellus\/4005-30996\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4005-30996\">Tellus<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Mind-controlled
        by Atmos<\/h4><p style=\"\">When the ruler of Xanthu (Star Boy''s home planet)
        asked Thom to be their resident hero since their champion <a href=\"\/atmos\/4005-28222\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4005-28222\">Atmos<\/a> had gone missing, Star Boy reluctantly
        had to take his leave from the Legion and Nura. While Star Boy was away, Atmos
        turned up during a Legion mission and Nura inexplicably found herself intensely
        attracted to him. To the surprise of her teammates, she broke up her long-distance
        relationship with Star Boy and jumped into a romance with Atmos. The truth
        later became apparent to her that Atmos was somehow using his mental powers
        to take over her emotions and sap her will. Furious at being so manipulated,
        she used her own formidable willpower to slowly build up a tolerance to Atmos''
        mind-sapping powers. She kept this a secret from her erstwhile lover until
        one night when Atmos had fallen asleep. She regained enough control over herself
        to activate her Legion flight ring alarm and knocked Atmos out cold with one
        punch the moment he woke up. Free of Atmos'' influence, Nura immediately went
        back to her true love Thom.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Five Years Later<\/h4><figure

        Wars<\/a>, Legion continuity was re-started after the period known as the
        Five Year Gap. The galactic economy had collapsed and Earth''s government
        became very hostile towards the Legion. Nura left the team and made her return
        to Naltor to become its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through
        the troubled times, and under her leadership her world became one of the most
        stable economies in the United Planets. But Nura felt alone and missed Star
        Boy terribly, so she went through a series of relationships with several men
        during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate
        some sort of time flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and
        just before the destruction of the time line, she shared a kiss with her old
        flame Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"..\/..\/zero-hour\/39-40782\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour<\/a> event.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Threeboot:
        Earth-Prime<\/h3><h4>Guiding the Legion<\/h4><p style=\"\">On Naltor, the
        Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl
        demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained
        that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would
        eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed
        that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work
        itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing
        the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three
        Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating
        on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that
        they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction,
        her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on
        the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not
        want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he
        refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl
        then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army.
        When she woke up she said one word... ''Brainy''. Dream Girl lead the team
        to the public service broadcaster where they found Brainy \"attacking the
        problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to
        let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security
        and comfort. She chose the former.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Relationship
        with Brainiac 5<\/h4><p style=\"\">When the team returned to Legion headquarters,
        Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one
        casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more
        unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to
        be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were
        married.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h4>Foreseeing Her Own Death<\/h4><p style=\"\">After
        this the Legion''s true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a
        href=\"..\/..\/terra-firma\/65-47457\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma<\/a>,
        lead by the super-powered <a href=\"..\/..\/elysion\/29-1274\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion<\/a>
        and <a href=\"..\/..\/lemnos\/29-1268\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos<\/a>. Terra
        Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision
        but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After
        Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she
        did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac
        5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem.
        Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed
        Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion.
        Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling
        powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos,
        the answer to Dream Girl''s problem was answered... she could not see past
        her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.<\/p><h4>Return
        to Life<\/h4><p style=\"\">After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force
        field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition
        despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed
        Dream Girl''s body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring
        her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful:
        Nura''s consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original
        body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this
        continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to
        get married.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth<\/h3><h4>The
        New 52<\/h4><p style=\"\">The efforts of DC to revitalize its titles led to
        the New 52 reboot of the universe, in which all DC titles were relaunched
        simultaneously. The Legion of Super Heroes reverted to a close analogue of
        their original continuity prior to any of reboots, but it remains to be seen
        the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and Star
        Boy are once again an official couple, though she also appears to have a strong
        relationship with <a href=\"\/brainiac-5\/4005-1255\/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac
        5<\/a>.<\/p><p style=\"\"> <\/p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities<\/h2><h3>Precognition<\/h3><p
        style=\"\">Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions.
        This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, but Nura''s
        ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition
        to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power
        of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see
        a few seconds into the future at any given moment.<\/p><p style=\"\"><strong>Unarmed
        Combat<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"\">Because of her passive power, Dream Girl''s
        early portrayal was a damsel-in-distress who could be easily defeated and
        captured by enemies, obliging her teammates to rescue her. She resolved to
        change this and spent long hours with the Legion''s ultimate martial arts
        master, Karate Kid, who gave her extensive training in hand-to-hand combat.
        She quickly became one of his most gifted students, to the point where she
        is now the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability
        is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows
        her to predict her opponent''s moves even before they make them and map out
        a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician,
        and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than
        her, such as the <a href=\"\/\">Persuader<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Intellect<\/h3><p
        style=\"\">Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered
        the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few
        Legionnaires to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual
        prowess. Because of her great intellect she was chosen for capture by the
        villain Universo, since he regarded her as one of the Legion''s four biggest
        threats to his domination of Earth (the others being <a href=\"\/saturn-girl\/4005-1273\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\">Saturn Girl<\/a>, <a href=\"\/chameleon-boy\/4005-5945\/\"
        data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\">Chameleon Boy<\/a>, and Brainiac 5).<\/p><p style=\"\">
        <\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p style=\"\">As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes,
        Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"..\/..\/legion-flight-ring\/18-47353\/\"
        rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring<\/a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability
        to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer''s willpower.
        It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact
        with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device,
        and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the
        ring. Dream Girl has also employed the ring in various ways unknown to other
        Legionnaires. Using her great willpower, Nura has used the flight ring to
        levitate and move other nearby objects as though she has telekinesis.<\/p><p
